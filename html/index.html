                The vehicle of choice was Starsky's two-door Ford Gran Torino, which was bright red, with a large white vector stripe on both sides only 4 used in production.
                <br>
                limited-production version of the Gran Torino hero is this iconic red-and-white 1976 Ford Gran Torino. <br>This car is a collectible with about 1,000 - 1,300 produced. This one has at least been restored with a fresher bright red paint job, iconic white stripe, chrome, mag wheels and magnetic bubble light for the roof.

In contrast to the exterior the inside looks more like a police car with black vinyl covering.

<br> Under the hood is the 351 Windsor V8 paired to a three-speed automatic transmission, which are believed to be original to the car.
